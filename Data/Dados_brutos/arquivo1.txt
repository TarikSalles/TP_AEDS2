Obstacle-Aware On-Track Bus Routing
The great advances achieved in very large scale integrated technology cause an increase in the difficulty for routing the buses through the spacing while minimizing the cost. The term bus defines a communication system that connects internal components in an integrated circuit. The routing process consists in placing the wires from the bus on space. There are some rules, related to wire width, the spacing between obstacles, routing direction, and others, we need to respect. The routing process can be separated in global routing and detailed routing. This paper presents a solution passing in both processes. In the global routing, we use a differential evolution based approach in a graph representation of the area to find a brute path of minimum length to guide the following step. By the next, we use a greedy selection to place the wires on the tracks. We compare the results achieved using a classic flux algorithm and three different mutation operators in differential evolution in global routing.
