Toward Nanometric Scale Integration: An Automatic Routing Approach for NML Circuits
In the recent years, many technologies have been studied in order to take place as a replacement or complement to CMOS. These emerging technologies, known as Field Coupled Nanotechnologies, seek to operate at nanometric scales and overcome the problems that are hard or impossible to be addressed by CMOS technology. However, these new technologies introduce the need of developing tools to perform circuit mapping, placement, and routing. NanoMagnetic Logic Circuit (NML) is one of these emergent technologies. It relies on the polarization of nanomagnets to perform operations through majority logic. In this work we propose an approach to automatically map a gatelevel circuit to a NML layout. We use the Breadth First Search to perform the placement and the A* algorithm to transverse the circuit and build the routes for each node. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we use a series of ISCASâ€™85 benchmarks. Our results show an area reduction varying from 20% to 60%.
