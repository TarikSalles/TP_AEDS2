1;  Obstacle-Aware On-Track Bus Routing; The great advances achieved in very large scale integrated technology cause an increase in the difficulty for routing the buses through the spacing while minimizing the cost The term bus defines a communication system that connects internal components in an integrated circuit The routing process consists in placing the wires from the bus on space There are some rules related to wire width the spacing between obstacles routing direction and others we need to respect The routing process can be separated in global routing and detailed routing This paper presents a solution passing in both processes In the global routing we use a differential evolution based approach in a graph representation of the area to find a brute path of minimum length to guide the following step By the next we use a greedy selection to place the wires on the tracks We compare the results achieved using a classic flux algorithm and three different mutation operators in differential evolution in global routing Index Termsâ€”VLSI IC routing bus differential evolution;
2; Toward Nanometric Scale Integration An Automatic Routing Approach for NML Circuits; In the recent years many technologies have been studied in order to take place as a replacement or complement to CMOS These emerging technologies known as Field Coupled Nanotechnologies seek to operate at nanometric scales and overcome the problems that are hard or impossible to be addressed by CMOS technology However these new technologies introduce the need of developing tools to perform circuit mapping placement and routing NanoMagnetic Logic Circuit NML is one of these emergent technologies It relies on the polarization of nanomagnets to perform operations through majority logic In this work we propose an approach to automatically map a gatelevel circuit to a NML layout We use the Breadth First Search to perform the placement and the A algorithm to transverse the circuit and build the routes for each node To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach we use a series of ISCAS85 benchmarks Our results show an area reduction varying from 20% to 60%; 
3; Improving Rule Based and Equivalent Decision Simplifications for Bloat Control in Genetic Programming Using a Dynamic Operator;  Bloat is a common issue regarding Genetic Programming GP specially noted in Symbolic Regression SR problems Due to this GP tends to generate a huge amount of ineffective code that could be avoided or removed Code editing is one of many approaches to avoid bloat The objective in this strategy is to mutate or remove subtrees which do not contribute to the final solution Two known methods of redundant code removal the Rule Based Simplification RBS and Equivalent Decision Simplification EDS are extended in a new operator presented in this paper called Dynamic Operator with RBS and EDS DORE This operator gives the algebraic simplification table used by RBS the potential to learn from reductions performed by EDS An initial benchmark highlighted how the RBS table can grow as much as 86% with DORE and reducing the time spent on simplification by 16.83% Experiments with the other three SR problems were performed showing a considerable improvement on fitness of the generated programs besides a slight reduction in the population of the average tree size Genetic Programming Bloat Control Code Editing;
4; Ropper A Placement and Routing Framework for Field-Coupled Nanotechnologies; Field-Coupled Nanocomputing technologies are the subject of extensive research to overcome current CMOS limitations These technologies include nanomagnetic and quantum structures each with its design and synchronization challenges In this scenario clocking schemes are used to ensure circuit synchronization and avoid signal disruptions at the cost of some area overhead Unfortunatelly a nanocomputing technology is limited to a small subset of clocking schemes due to its number of clocking phases and signal propagation system thus leading to complex design challenges when tackling the placement and routing problem resulting in technology dependant solutions Our work consists on presenting a novel framework developed by our team that solves these design challenges when using distinct schemes therefore avoiding the need to design pre-defined routing algorithms for each one The framework offers a technology independent solution and provides interfaces for the implementation of efficient and scalable placement strategies moreover it has full integration with reference state-of-the-art optimization and synthesis tools placement routing clocking scheme framework synthesis generic;
